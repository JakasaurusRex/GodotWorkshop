# What is Godot?

A game engine is a tool that allows for ease of creation of games. Game engines have features that make it easy to make whatever you can dream up! An example of some features common in game engines are the following:
- Physics Engines - The engine automatically does physics calculations for you, abstracting a lot of math!
- Display Rendering and Shading Engines - Game engines abstract the compleixty that goes into creating a display on your screen
- Ease of accessing controls - Game engines make it easy to allow users to interact with the softare by having hardware events for interaction with keyboards, mice, controllers, or any other type of input.
- Sound Engines - Game engines feature sound engines allowing it easy to play sounds on a computer.
- More! - Game engines have tons of technically challenging features abstracted

Some well known game engines are Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, CryEngine, GameMaker, PyGame, RPGMaker, and Scratch.

You can also create your own game engine using any programming language! It is pretty involved as you have to figure out how to interact with the computer to display and make sounds on your own but these challenges can be really rewarding to solve!

## What sets Godot appart from other game engines?

A number of features set Godot appart from the pack.

1) Godot is completely **free**
   
This is really critical. A lot of game engines are free for personal use but cost money if you want to actually make professional games with them. Godot is free no matter if you are a huge development team or a solo developer making games for fun!


2) Godot is **lightweight**
   
Upon downloading the game enigne, you will notice how easy it is to use on your computer! Game engines are historically large programs that consume a lot of memory and processing power. Godot on the otherhand is very easy to run on any computer and its download size is around 500 MB, smaller than most social media apps! It can also run on any type of computer!

3) Godot is **Open-Source**

An open-source application is an application that's sourcecode is publicly available online. The developers of Godot are people in the game development community that use Godot and publicly contribute to the project. What this means is that Goodt will always be free and the community is super supportive and open to allow the app to be prosperious!

4) Godot is **EASY!!!**

Game engines are sterotypically super complicated, packed with tons of features that are poorly explained. Godot is suprisingly insanely easy to get started with. It features a Python-like programming language called GDScript with documentation built into the application. Hovering over any library function allows you to pull up the wiki page for what that function does and how it works. Features mostly behave as you would expect making it super easy to start making games with Godot after getting over the initial learner barrier as you will soon see!

For these reasons, we will be teaching and recommending Godot to be used for LionJam and future game jams!
